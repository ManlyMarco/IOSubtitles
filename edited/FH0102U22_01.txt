When I'm tired, my chest and head are shocked straight from the navel, and it makes me shiver.
It's like I'm being pulled through with a full-body cramp, and I'm getting too sensitive, and I feel like my head is going to melt.
This is such wonderful normal ecstasy.
riveting praise to the top,
smashing your head so hard you're going to break your manko…
With these large axis, give me a great job…
Please!
