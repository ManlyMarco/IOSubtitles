Ah, ah, ah, ah, use it!
Use it to wash your face!
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah,
it's a lot of anti-aging ingredients!
Ah, ah, ah,
thank you for marking my face with a toilet paper.
This smell...
...is just a habit.
Ah, ah, ah, ah,
this smelly furniture that looks like it's going back and forth,
and my head being hit,
I can't think of anything.
The smell that makes me feel good...
...
My hands and face are full of dirty clothes.
Ah, ah, ah, ah,
a chinkushu that's only for erotic faces.
Ah, ah, ah,
please apply more.
Ah, ah, ah, ah,
