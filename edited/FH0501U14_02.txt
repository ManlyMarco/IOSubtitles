Why are you rubbing it on my cheek?
I'm doing it with my hands.
You don't even have to use your face.
If you come all the way to the tip of your nose,
you'll get rid of the smell.
I'm going to take it back with my hands.
I'm holding back my hands.
I'm very nervous.
I'm embarrassed.
My cheeks are very hot.
I feel tired over and over again.
I'm excited.
