I'm feeling it even though I'm trying to be strong...
I can't help it...
The tail that's pulling the thread...
It's foaming...
It's turning white...
It's becoming like a spirit...
It's like it's being hit by a star...
I'm getting excited...
I don't mind if I take it out anytime...
Please... give me a lot of support...
