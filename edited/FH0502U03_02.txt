I'm being used by Onii-san over and over again.
No matter how many times I put it out, it doesn't swell, and I love it.
Just by touching it, my blood pressure goes up.
I need to concentrate and pull it out properly. It's going to hurt.
I want to put it in again and get a lot of it out.
Now I have to be patient with just my hands.
