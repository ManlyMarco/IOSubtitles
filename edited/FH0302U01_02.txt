Ah, the fact that I'm crying is my pride.
When I think that it's a crazy thing, I get excited.
I want to be more zuppo-zuppo. I can't control it.
Even though I'm just talking, I'm annoying, I want to be touched.
It's been a long time since I've been like this.
I'm completely out of my youth.
I have to thank you.
I'll take my time to get used to it.
