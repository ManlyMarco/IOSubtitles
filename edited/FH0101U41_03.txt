Ah, ah, ah, I really like this.
I feel like I'm going to melt and melt.
I feel like I'm going to get mixed up and I feel like I'm going to lose again and again.
I'm going to do my best to get a shot while I'm struggling with the meat.
I feel like I'm being treated kindly, but I feel like I'm being cheated on.
Every time I move, my blood pressure goes up.
I want you to forgive me.
I want Master's life.
