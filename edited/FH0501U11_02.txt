Ugh...
Geez...
Sucking my boobs...
It's so unfair to be spoiled...
I'm like a baby...
I shouldn't be kissing...
I'm always being teased...
Somehow...
I feel like I'm cute...
Geez...
I'm so sick of being spoiled...
I can't do anything about it...
I wonder if I'll be happy if I do this and that...
I'm starting to feel weird...
I'm a good girl, so...
Don't suck my boobs...
