Ha...ha...ha...
You twist your fingers slowly...
Hummm...
You hold your head up high...
Hum...hum...
I'm not used to it...
Hum...hum...
And then...
You come up from inside the bag...
Is that how it's going to be?
Hum...hum...
If you get tired of it...
Hum...
I can't hold it in anymore...
It's overflowing at once...
Hum...
I-it's too much...
Amazing reaction...
Uncle...
My legs are shaking...
Hum...hum...
It feels...good...
It's embarrassing...
It's making my heart skip a beat...
Hum...hum...
