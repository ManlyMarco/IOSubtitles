...I can see what kind of face you're making.
You can see my face, too.
The weak part...
Every time I get tired, I face becomes shameless.
I want to spread my legs wider and go deeper.
I want to appeal to you.
My eyes...
I can feel it more than I can see.
I've been fooled, I've been messed up, I've been messed up.
It's embarrassing, but I can feel it.
