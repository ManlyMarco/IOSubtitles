I can't do it. I'm so tired that I can't breathe.
I can't breathe.
I'm going to do it normally.
I'm going to do it normally.
I'm going to do it normally.
It's stuck in my eyes.
It's stuck in my throat.
It's stuck in my throat.
It hurts so much.
I'm going to lick it properly, so I don't like this.
If I do it too hard, I'll hit my teeth.
I can't do it.
