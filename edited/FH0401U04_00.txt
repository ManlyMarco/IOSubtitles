Why...
Don't push me...
Don't bend me...
...
My breath is rising...
Every time I make a cup...
My voice is...
Ah...
No...
Don't tease me there...
Cup is sensitive...
...
I don't want to be told by someone like that...
It's frustrating...
But...
My whole body is getting hot...
Why...
It can't be...
...
No...
...
I can't...
...
