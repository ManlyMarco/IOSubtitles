Even though I'm facing you, it feels like they're attacking me one-sidedly.
The deepest part...
When I'm pushed up by their internal organs, it feels like I'm under great pressure.
No! Don't do it over and over again!
It feels weird, but when I come closer, it feels good.
No...
It feels good to raise my voice.
Even though you're attacking me from behind, I'm going all out.
No...
No...
