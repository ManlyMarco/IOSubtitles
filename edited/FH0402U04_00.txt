The sweat of excitement and the overflowing cow-powder are entwined and the cheeks are stuck to the dorsal fin.
The dorsal fin doesn't let go of me, getting stronger every time I rub it.
It's crushed, pushed out, transformed into a distorted shape, and the dorsal fin is rubbed.
Every time the dorsal fin is wrinkled, it is transmitted to the chest.
I'm so happy to think that such an old woman's boobs are making me so excited that I'm about to die.
