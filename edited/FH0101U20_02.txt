Don't look at me... It's embarrassing... My eyes meet yours... W-What's wrong with you?
You're in my favorite pot... Because... You're making a more embarrassing face... Don't look at me...
It feels good... I can't stand it... I can't stand it...
When I feel it, it makes me angry... Don't look at me... You're making a more embarrassing face...
I don't want to look at you... It's embarrassing...
