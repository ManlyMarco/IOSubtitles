I can't let go of my master's handkerchief.
I'm soaked in a thick blanket.
I'm getting soaked too.
I want to get soaked in the blanket.
I'm wetting it in my mouth and begging.
It's slippery, so I dip it.
I'm wetting hot water from the baby room.
This kind of baby milk coffee suits you.
I want to kiss a lot.
I like baby fundamentally.
I want to kiss a milk-loving cat.
Shaka, are you okay?
I love this.
I love baby fundamentally.
My hips are moving.
I'm wetting hot water from the baby room.
