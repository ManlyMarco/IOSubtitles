The fire is swallowing the Chimpo
It's swallowing it over and over again
It's more exciting than a normal H
The Chimpo that's throbbing and writhing
Do you understand?
It's so throbbing that it reaches to my brain
It's a bit messy
It's rubbing on my feet
I want some noodles
I'm the Chimpo
It's not being teased
The Chimpo is fluttering
It's turning into a pervert
