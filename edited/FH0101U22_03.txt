Ah...Ah...Ah...
Don't get too excited just by staring at me...
Don't get too excited...
That alone will make me feel like I'm going to die!
My husband's body is hot...
We're stuck together...
We're moving as if we're connected...
I'm looking for a comfortable place...
I like it...
It feels like there's only pleasure in my head...
It feels like I'm a beast...
I like it...
The weight of my body feels good...
I like all the intense breath and sweat I've been sweating...
