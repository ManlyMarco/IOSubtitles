It's rubbing against my hand and cheek, it's getting bigger, it's smelly, I'm getting excited, when I hold it tight, it's like it's producing a huge amount of protein.
It's rubbing against my fingertips, it's pulling a thread, it's disgusting, it's making me want to puke, it's making me want to puke, I don't like it.
