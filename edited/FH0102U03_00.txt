Gah, it looks like the weather's changing to change, using my brain as a tracer to run...
I can't possibly keep this calm, my insides're not really curvy anymore, and my legs are drying up so easily...
It's going too far... No, I'm going to fall for it... If I keep falling for it like this, I won't be able to get out of it...
