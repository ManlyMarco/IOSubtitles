...Pant, pant. Pant, pant.
I love you, my dear.
Pant, pant.
Don't sneeze.
Pant, pant.
You need to breathe properly.
Pant, pant.
Pant, pant.
If you make a sound, your nipples will come back.
Geez...
Pant, pant.
If you sneeze, you'll be shoved into a ball.
Pant, pant.
There, there.
You can sneeze whenever you want.
Pant, pant.
You're so cute that my heart is pounding.
Your nipples are twitching.
Pant, pant.
I feel like I'm about to puke.
Pant, pant.
Leave everything to me.
You can relax more.
Pant, pant.
You're so cute.
I'll show you where to go.
Come on, come on.
Pant, pant.
