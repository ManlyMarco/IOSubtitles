If I put my strength into it, I feel like I'm going to blow out the djinnpa.
I'm going to get dizzy.
I'm going to rub my face.
It feels good.
If I get cornered by the djinnpa, I feel like I'm going to die.
I'm being put in a gas hole.
I'm taking in the djinnpa.
Kizuna, you're as sensitive as Kuriru.
