Don't do that​
I feel so guilty​
Look at the napkin​
You are so excited​
Having a Thoracic surgery​
I think I will​
retake that​
I think I amongs the thunder now​
I keep confidentiness​
I feel so low again​
I feel like I am being tortured​
I am so weak​
I will die​
I will die​
Let go of my hand​
I will​
die at the same time​
I will​
die​
I want to put a nipple in my mouth​
That's why I can't do it​
