...Ah, my gums are so full of pain...
It's so hot...
If I give you a little bit...
You'll be overflowing with patience...
Even so, you're drooling like a drool...
My gums are so full of pain...
My throat is so red...
If I give you a little bit...
You'll be overflowing with patience...
You're so cute...
My heart is pounding...
