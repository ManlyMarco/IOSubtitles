Ah, a total failure...
I was just going to be a little more positive...
But I lost vs. my Idora even again...
Even though I'm in pain, I'm fine.
After laughing and going through all thoseenschì™€ survives...
I NEWLY least expect and can't get rid of it...
But once I lost all my energy...
I finally arrived with an asteroid...
That edgey voice of mine is all weird...
It's moving differently when I touch it for no reason...
It'sgeeky and whining when I get closer to it.
