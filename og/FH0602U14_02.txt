Even though I'm pinching you so hard, I can't rub you that much.
I can feel it, too. I feel like I'm going to fall with my feet.
I'm more breathless than my brother.
I can hear the sound of bubbles.
I'm going to explode with the smell of vinegar.
I can't stand it. I feel like I'm going to get used to this eerie play.
I'm so excited to be used to using my legs to squeeze my mind.
