Nnngh...
Every time I get a kiss, my voice goes out...
And when I react to it...
My chest starts to tickle...
Nnngh...
Nnngh...
It's getting bigger...
It's getting harder...
Nnngh...
It's so grotesque with a blue line...
It's so grotesque with a blue line...
Nnngh...
From the inside of my cheeks...
There's a smell...
Nnngh...
It's directly on my nose...
This...
This is the smell of soap, isn't it?
Nnngh...
Is it coming out?
Does it feel good?
I-If it's coming out, hurry up...
I'm sure you'll be satisfied if you get your chest and face dirty with soap...
Nnngh...
I-If that's the case...
Hurry up and finish it...
It's too late to refuse...
I won't do it...
Give me the smell of soap...
Nnngh...
