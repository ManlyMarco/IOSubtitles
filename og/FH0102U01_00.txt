N-no...
Don't look at me like that...
You're like a hungry beast...
You're going to make me lose my mind...
You're not the one who's being stubborn...
That person...
Seek me with more gentle eyes...
No, no, no!
Don't push me too hard!
Don't make me feel good...
Don't push me too hard...
I can feel it...
But...
I can't...
