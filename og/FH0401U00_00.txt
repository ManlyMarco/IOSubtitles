Stop it, it makes me feel sick.
My boobs...
Don't touch me!
Don't rub my dandruff!
It tickles...
It's hot...
My dandruff is big...
With this...
It doesn't feel good...
No...
It tickles...
I can't believe it...
It's so hard...
My chest...
It's being moved...
I can't move...
It's the worst...
I don't like it...
