Uwaaah!
Uwaaah!
Just now...
I was so scared...
My vision was flickering...
Uwaaah...
My voice came out as loud as I could...
No?
It wasn't?
No...
I can feel it with my heart...
It was easy...
I shouldn't have found out...
I shouldn't have found out...
It's coming again...
My edgy nose...
It's sticking to my cheeks...
