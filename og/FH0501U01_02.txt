It tickles so much...
The roots...
It's so thick that I can't move my fingers...
My limbs are too weak...
Even if I take them off, they get bigger...
I'm a pervert...
If I do it with my hands...
The shape and size...
If I know it well...
I get nervous for no reason...
This is what's inside of me...
I remember it now...
