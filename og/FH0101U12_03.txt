I can't stop this eerie voice...
Every time I'm tired, I feel it, and I start to scream...
I feel like I'm being crushed by the flesh...
It feels so good...
It's so blue...
I wonder what kind of eyes are looking at me...
I feel like I'm being crushed by my waist, and I can't run away...
I'm such a pervert...
I feel like I'm being crushed...
But I can't stop this eerie voice...
It feels so good...
