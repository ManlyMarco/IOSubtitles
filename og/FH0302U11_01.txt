If you try to get away from me, I'll push you in.
The smell of vinegar is coming up from my throat, and I'm being turned into a toy.
I'm suffering, but I don't care.
I'm being used up all over my mouth.
I'm being swallowed up.
I feel like I'm being sucked in.
Ten steps, ten steps, and I hear a very annoying sound.
It's like I'm being cheated on.
I'm getting excited.
I'm getting excited as much as I'm suffering.
