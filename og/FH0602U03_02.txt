I'm starting to love you so much.
I love you.
Even though you're on my side, I still think you're cute.
I want to be with you more.
I want to feel you more.
When I look at you, I want to take care of you a lot.
My body is very hot.
I've been hit, I've been bullied, I've been bullied, I've been bullied, I've been bullied, I've been bullied.
