Ah, there's a lot of dandelions, and a lot of dandelions in here.
Everything is filled up.
The most important thing is to make a baby with that person.
Ah, it's a different dandelion.
It's stuck up in a mess.
It's turned into an ugly face that I've never seen before.
I'm blowing up the dandelions.
The dandelions are peeled off, and they're blowing up like a bunch of dandelions in a row.
I can't stop.
Ah!
