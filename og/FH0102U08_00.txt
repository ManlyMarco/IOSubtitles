Geez!
My self-righteous leer!
It looks to me as if CANNED as a ring
My love makes me over if I sing
As I Clan made my voice as high as I can
It sounds so high
I thought that I was forced to sing
Though I absolutely didn't want to
Oh, the scream
I can't wait to call out
Even though my tenderly egotistical
It's not
I've been noticed
I'm sorry
But I can't control my body's reaction anymore
