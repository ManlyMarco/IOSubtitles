Ah, I can feel it, I can feel it.
Ah, ah, I can feel it, I can feel it.
I have to endure it.
Ah, wow, I couldn't reach that person.
Ah, I'm tired of being a dork.
I'm tired of being a dork.
Ah, ah, if I rub it, a big wave will come.
I'm sorry for being a dork.
I can't stand it anymore.
I'm sorry.
Ah, I feel good.
Ah.
