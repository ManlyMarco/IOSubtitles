It's so hard, and it looks like it's going to hurt so much.
I'll squeeze everything out and make you feel better.
More, more.
It feels good when I squeeze it out, but now it's like I'm holding it in and spreading it out.
Don't squeeze it out yet. Let me have more fun.
It's coming up.
I know. It feels so good.
Let's have more fun together.
