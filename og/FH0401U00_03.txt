Fufu...
Master's chimps are trembling with pain.
They always adored me, but now they're bullying me.
They were so scary, but now they're so cute...
...
It's okay, feel it with more pain...
...
If you feel such a painful master's chimps in your chest, my boobs will also be painful...
It's painful, it's frustrating, and it's hard to breastfeed them...
