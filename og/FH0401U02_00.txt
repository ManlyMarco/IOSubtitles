Don't show it to me. I don't want to see your chimp. Don't get excited. Don't make it any bigger.
It was a strange movement. The shape of the chimp. The hunt is caught and I know it.
It's a strange color. The black lines are clearly floating.
I hate it. The juice is overflowing. The boobs are sticky.
It stinks. I hate the smell.
