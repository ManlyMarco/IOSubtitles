...
The hard chimp...
...was taken out...
...and cleaned up...
...
I'm sorry, Master...
In fact, the cat had to do it by itself...
I'm sorry for making you worry about your master's chimp...
It's too big...
...and full of mouth...
I'm about to cry...
It's just the smell of my master's pee...
It's so dirty...
...I can't turn my head...
I can't help but taste the pee...
I'm going to taste it...
...and feel dizzy...
