...
I'm being chased and it's heavy...
It's stuck to me...
Even though I'm not your girlfriend...
I-I don't hate you...
The moment we pass by each other is so close...
It's like I'm being attached to you...
I don't know if I like you or not...
I'm being chased and it's heavy...
It's like I'm being attached to you...
It's embarrassing...
It's heavy...
It's stuck to me...
