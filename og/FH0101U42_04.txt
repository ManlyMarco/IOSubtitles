It feels so good to be in a beast's mirror.
When I'm tired in this posture, the angle is amazing.
I'm going to take a break over and over again.
The shape that fits perfectly.
It's perfectly perfect.
It's a heart-shaped container.
It's a heart-shaped container and it's tight.
Uwaaah!
Ah!
Uwaah!
Uwaah!
I can't help but laugh when I think about it.
I can't stop laughing!
I want to keep laughing.
I want to keep laughing from the beginning to the end.
I love you!
I love you so much!
Uwaah!
Ah!
