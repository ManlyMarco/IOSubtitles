Uh, uh, uh, uh...
loudly eating my brother's d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d-d
T-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t-t
My chin is...
about the same size as yours, y-y-y-y...
It makes me j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-j-ink, when someone bullies me...
H-h-h-h-h...
When I work as hard as I can...
Well, then...
I'm going to broke.
It's way too embarrassing for me to bend forward and be able to do nothing.
My Brother's chin is so little
it's even a little Buterfly.
I'm pretty too.
I'm getting angry.
My chin is tripping.
I'm being little.
