Ah, I like it. I like Pizlifera.
I'll use my chest and mouth to release it.
I can't help but get excited when I can feel the chimp with all my five senses.
I'm going to get up and lick more.
I'm going to lick more.
I'm going to lick my chest and mouth with my chimp.
I can't stop drooling.
It's mixed with the carpet.
Give me more.
Give me more chimp in my chest and mouth.
Give me more chimp in my chest and mouth.
