Ah, my heart is beating so fast, my cheeks are getting hot and my cheeks are tingling.
I'm just doing it with my chest, but my body is about to fly away.
Why?
I was forced to be used like a holy tree.
I'm just being used like a holy tree.
No, I want to make my uncle live on my own.
I don't want to be treated like a holy tree.
