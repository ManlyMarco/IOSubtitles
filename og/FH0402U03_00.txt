To watch me so nervous, that I'm so excited,
That another person is attacking my itchy curses
Her eyes should look down at my sectional beauty finishes me off
Don't look at me like that
I'm going to become a more handsome person
I'm going to want to have a baby
I can't have a baby, but I'm going to want to have a baby
I can't
