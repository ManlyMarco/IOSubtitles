Oh, it's starting to overflow from within...
This is so good, my lips are welding while I'm moving my lips...
The gas from my mouth is plunging into one's throat, deep in there...
It stings from the insomnia jumpers in my chest,
I take a bad step, firmly, and I firmly hold the gas,
calm, how do you feel?
It's like your old lady's Cambodia tea, my back is tingling, it subscriptionãƒ­
I'll make you feel even better
