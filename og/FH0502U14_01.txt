Don't grab my head... My heart is beating so fast...
When I look at it up close, it's amazing...
It's like my face is being moved...
My hands are hot, my arms are crumpled...
I feel weird...
It's embarrassing...
I'm being shown, I'm being hit by a book...
I'm just holding it lightly, but I can take it off...
It's overflowing, it's getting dirty...
